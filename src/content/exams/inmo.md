# INMO 2025: Indian National Mathematical Olympiad (by HBCSE)

## What is INMO?

The **Indian National Mathematical Olympiad (INMO)** is the third stage in India’s mathematics Olympiad program. Organized by **Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE)** under NBHM, it follows the Regional Mathematical Olympiad (RMO) and identifies top talent for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) selection.

## Eligibility & Selection Process

1. **Stage 1 – IOQM** (formerly PRMO): Qualifier with \~30 integer-response questions; \~900 students advance.
2. **Stage 2 – RMO**: 3-hour paper with 6 challenging problems; top performers (\~300–450) get selected.
3. **Stage 3 – INMO**: About 900 students (30 from classes 8–11, 6 from class 12 per region + five girls' quota) qualify for INMO.
4. **Stage 4 – IMOTC & PDC**: Top \~35 from INMO attend training camp; 6 finalists chosen for the IMO team.

## INMO 2025 Exam Pattern

* **Date:** 3rd Sunday of January.
* **Duration:** 4 hours 30 minutes.
* **Format:** 6 subjective problems, equally weighted, requiring full solutions .
* **Total Marks:** \~102 (typically 17 points each) without negative marking.
* **Allowed Materials:** Non-programmable scientific calculator, geometry tools (ruler, compass).

---

## Syllabus & Topics

Based on pre-degree CBSE class XI–XII math but includes challenging Olympiad problems:

* **Algebra:** Polynomials, equations, inequalities, sequences & series, complex numbers, functional equations.
* **Geometry:** Euclidean geometry, circle theorems, advanced constructions.
* **Number Theory:** Integer arithmetic, divisibility, modular/congruences, elementary combinatorics.
* **Combinatorics & Probability:** Counting, graph theory, basic probabilities.
* **Calculus-Like Tools:** Optional methods may be used, but problems avoid heavy calculus .

---

## Preparation Cheat Sheet

* **Past Papers:** Practice INMO & RMO past papers with full solutions.
* **Essential Texts:**

  * *Challenge & Thrill of Pre‑College Mathematics* – for combinatorics, algebra.
  * *Euclidean Geometry in Mathematical Olympiads* or Loney’s geometry texts.
  * *Functional Equations and Inequalities* by Venkatachala.
* **Strategy:**

  * Develop proof-writing: clarity, presentation, rigor.
  * Work with peers/mentors; discuss alternate solutions.
  * Focus on conceptual depth over speed at this level.

---

## Awards & Recognition

* Top \~35 students qualify for the **IMO Training Camp (IMOTC)**.
* Certification as **INMO awardees**, with access to NBHM scholarships (\~₹2,500/month).
* Direct entry benefits for premier institutes like **CMI B.Sc.(Hons)** and **ISI B.Stat/B.Math**.
