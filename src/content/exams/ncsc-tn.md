# NCSC – Tamil Nadu (State-Level National Children’s Science Congress)

## What is NCSC?

The **National Children’s Science Congress (NCSC)** is a science communication initiative by DST–NCSTC (launched in 1993) that encourages children aged **10–17** to undertake locally relevant science-based projects and present solutions .
Tamil Nadu hosts a **state-level event** each year—evidenced by multiple instances, such as the 25th edition in 2017—followed by participation in the national Congress .
