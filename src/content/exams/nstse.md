## Cheat Sheet & Preparation Tips

### Critical Thinking

* Focus on patterns, series, classification, logic puzzles
* Practice decision-based and inductive reasoning questions

### Mathematics & Science (Lower Classes)

* Strengthen arithmetic, geometry, measurements, basic physics/biology through NCERT
* Build conceptual clarity with flashcards and practice sets

### Subject-Specific (VI–X)

* **Mathematics:** Number systems, algebraic expressions, geometry, data interpretation
* **Science Trio:** Physics (motion, light), Chemistry (matter, reactions), Biology (life processes)

### Higher Classes (XI–XII)

* **PCM:** Advanced calculus, algebra, mechanics, thermodynamics, organic chemistry
* **PCB:** Deep dive into physiology, cell biology, environmental science
* **Critical Thinking:** High-order problem-solving

### General Preparation

* Simulate full-length tests under timed conditions
* Analyze errors; revise targeted topics quickly
* Refer to Unified Council **Success Series** and **sample papers**
* Build conceptual-level understanding instead of rote memorization
