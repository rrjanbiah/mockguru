# Indian Computing Olympiad (ICO) 2025: Complete Guide

## What is ICO?

The **Indian Computing Olympiad (ICO)** is India's top-tier algorithm and programming contest organized annually by **IARCS** iarcs.org.in. Its purpose is to identify talented school students and select four to represent India at the **International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)**.

---

## Eligibility & Registration

* **Open to:** All students enrolled in school through Class 12 in the academic year of participation.
* **No age limit**, but Class 12 completers are not eligible.
* **Registration:** Opens around October for the next cycle (e.g., ICO–2026 in Oct 2025).

## Exam Stages & Pattern

### 1. Zonal Round (First Stage)

* **ZIO (Zonal Informatics Olympiad)**

  * Pen-and-paper written exam
  * \~4 problems, 12 sub-parts, 3 hours, 80 marks.
* **ZCO (Zonal Computing Olympiad)**

  * Online programming contest (C++, Java, Python)
  * Typically 2 algorithmic problems, timed.
* **Advancement:** Qualify via either ZIO or ZCO.

### 2. INOI (Indian National Olympiad in Informatics)

* Programming exam (C++ only)
* \~2 complex problems, 3 hours.

### 3. IOITC (International Olympiad in Informatics Training Camp)

* \~30 top INOI performers attend 7-day training (June 2025).

### 4. IOI Selection

* Top 4 from IOITC form Team India for IOI (Bolivia, July 27–August 3, 2025).

## Syllabus & Preparation

### ZIO & ZCO Topics

* Basic algorithms and data structures: sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, graphs .
* Discrete mathematics and problem-solving logic .

### INOI & IOITC

* Advanced algorithmic concepts per IOI syllabus:

  * Graph theory, DP, greedy techniques, advanced data structures, combinatorics.

### Prep Resources

* **IARCS Online Materials:** targeted topic notes and problem archive.
* **Practice Platforms:** IARCS judge, CodeChef, CodeDrills, Commonlounge.
* **Books:** *Algorithm Design* (Kleinberg–Tardos), *Introduction to Algorithms* (CLRS), *Competitive Programming* (Halim), *Programming Challenges* (Skiena).

---

## Marking Scheme & Logistics

* **ZIO:** Scored per sub-part; full marks typically 80–100.
* **ZCO & INOI:** Partial scoring based on successful test cases.
* **INOI onwards:** C++ only.
* **No negative marking** unless specified.

---

## Rewards & Opportunities

* **Medals at INOI:** \~60 awardees (11 Gold, 19 Silver, 30 Bronze).
* **IOITC admission** equals fast-track to IOI.
* **Institutional perks:** CMI, IIIT Delhi/Hyderabad, IITs, Amrita, IIIT‑Hyderabad etc. offer direct admissions or bonus points.
* **International exposure:** IOI + APIO selection; national achievements bolster competitive programming careers.
