## Exam Format & Marking

### Level 1 (Offline, OMR-based, 60 minutes)

| Classes | Qs | Sections Summary                                                                                     | Total Marks |
| ------- | -- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1–4     | 35 | Logical, Mathematical, Everyday Math (10 Q each), Achievers (5 Qs × 2 marks)                         | 40          |
| 5–12    | 50 | Logical Reasoning (15 Q), Math/Applied Math (20 Q), Everyday Math (10 Q), Achievers (5 Qs × 3 marks) | 60          |

* **Logical Reasoning**: patterns, classification, analogies, series

* **Mathematical Reasoning**: class-level math logic

* **Everyday Maths**: applied arithmetic and basic concepts

* **Achievers Section**: higher-order questions from current class 

* **No negative marking** 

### Level 2

* **Classes 3–4:** 35 Qs (30 × 1 mark + 5 achievers × 2) = **40 marks**
* **Classes 5–12:** 50 Qs with same structure as Level 1 = **60 marks**
