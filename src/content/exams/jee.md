# JEE 2025: Complete Overview and Cheat Sheet

## What is JEE?

The **Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)** is India’s national-level engineering entrance test conducted for admission to top engineering institutions including **IITs**, **NITs**, **IIITs**, and **other centrally funded technical institutes (CFTIs)**. It is conducted in two phases:

- **JEE Main:** Conducted by **NTA**, for admission to NITs, IIITs, and qualifying for JEE Advanced.
- **JEE Advanced:** Conducted by **IITs**, for admission to IITs.
