# INPhO 2025: Indian National Physics Olympiad (by HBCSE)

## What is INPhO?

The **Indian National Physics Olympiad (INPhO)** is the **second stage** in Indiaâ€™s national physics Olympiad pathway, organized by **HBCSE**. Students first clear the **National Standard Examination in Physics (NSEP)** before competing in this advanced theoretical examination. Top performers progress to the **Orientation Cum Selection Camp (OCSC)** and eventually, the Indian team is selected for the **International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)**â€¯.

## Eligibility & Selection Process

1. **Stage I â€“ NSEP (November):**

   * 60 single-correct + 12 multiple-correct MCQs over 2 hours; +3/â€“1 for singles and +6/no penalty for multiples.
   * Top \~300â€“450 qualifiers, including state quotas and Merit Index, advance to INPhO.

2. **Stage II â€“ INPhO (Late Jan/Feb):**

   * Around 300â€“400 students write this exam.
   * Questions are fully **subjective**: typically 5â€“6 challenging problems in 3 hoursâ€¯.

3. **Selection for OCSC:**

   * Top \~35 students (split into Class XI/XII and younger) qualify.

4. **OCSC & IPhO Selection:**

   * Top 35 attend OCSC; final 5â€“6 are trained for IPhO.

## Exam Pattern & Marking

| Stage     | Format                      | Marks/Questions                | Time     |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| **NSEP**  | MCQs (60 single + 12 multi) | +3/â€“1 (singles), +6/0 (multis) | 120 minâ€¯ |
| **INPhO** | Subjective problems         | 5â€“6 long-answer questions      | 180 minâ€¯ |

* **Calculators:** Basic non-programmable scientific allowed.

---

## Syllabus

* Based on **CBSE Class XIâ€“XII physics**, but problems are **non-conventional and conceptually deep**.
* Topics include Mechanics, Thermodynamics, EM, Optics, Modern Physics, Waves â€“ up to IPhO standardsâ€¯.
* Practical awareness also plays a role during OCSC.

## Prep Cheat Sheet ðŸŽ¯

### NSEP Prep

* Focus on speed & accuracy in MCQs â€“ hone problem-solving from CBSE plus JEE-level questions.
* Practice older NSEP papers first.

### INPhO Prep

* Build strong theory: try **Hallidayâ€“Resnickâ€“Krane**, **Griffiths**, and **Pathfinder** for Olympiad depth.
* Practice past INPhO papers with solutions from HBCSE website.
* Join peer groups, focus on written, stepwise problem-solving.

### OCSC Preparation

* Intensive training in both theoretical and experimental challenges.
* Learn advanced topics: Relativity, Thermodynamics, Quantum.
* Revise with mock tests and previous OCSC papers.

---

## Rewards & Recognition

* **Qualification-based medals and certificates** across NSEP and INPhO levels.
* OCSC attendees receive training, honor, and IIT/CMI admissions.
* IPhO qualifiers gain national acclaim and potential career opportunities.
