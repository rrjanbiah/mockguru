{"pageProps":{"content":"\n\n# INPhO 2025: Indian National Physics Olympiad (by HBCSE)\n\n## What is INPhO?\n\nThe **Indian National Physics Olympiad (INPhO)** is the **second stage** in Indiaâ€™s national physics Olympiad pathway, organized by **HBCSE**. Students first clear the **National Standard Examination in Physics (NSEP)** before competing in this advanced theoretical examination. Top performers progress to the **Orientation Cum Selection Camp (OCSC)** and eventually, the Indian team is selected for the **International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)**â€¯.\n\n---\n\n## Eligibility & Selection Process\n\n1. **Stage I â€“ NSEP (November):**\n\n   * 60 single-correct + 12 multiple-correct MCQs over 2 hours; +3/â€“1 for singles and +6/no penalty for multiples.\n   * Top \\~300â€“450 qualifiers, including state quotas and Merit Index, advance to INPhO.\n\n2. **Stage II â€“ INPhO (Late Jan/Feb):**\n\n   * Around 300â€“400 students write this exam.\n   * Questions are fully **subjective**: typically 5â€“6 challenging problems in 3 hoursâ€¯.\n\n3. **Selection for OCSC:**\n\n   * Top \\~35 students (split into Class XI/XII and younger) qualify.\n\n4. **OCSC & IPhO Selection:**\n\n   * Top 35 attend OCSC; final 5â€“6 are trained for IPhO.\n\n---\n\n## Exam Pattern & Marking\n\n| Stage     | Format                      | Marks/Questions                | Time     |\n| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |\n| **NSEP**  | MCQs (60 single + 12 multi) | +3/â€“1 (singles), +6/0 (multis) | 120 minâ€¯ |\n| **INPhO** | Subjective problems         | 5â€“6 long-answer questions      | 180 minâ€¯ |\n\n* **Calculators:** Basic non-programmable scientific allowed.\n\n---\n\n## Syllabus\n\n* Based on **CBSE Class XIâ€“XII physics**, but problems are **non-conventional and conceptually deep**.\n* Topics include Mechanics, Thermodynamics, EM, Optics, Modern Physics, Waves â€“ up to IPhO standardsâ€¯.\n* Practical awareness also plays a role during OCSC.\n\n---\n\n## Prep Cheat Sheet ðŸŽ¯\n\n### NSEP Prep\n\n* Focus on speed & accuracy in MCQs â€“ hone problem-solving from CBSE plus JEE-level questions.\n* Practice older NSEP papers first.\n\n### INPhO Prep\n\n* Build strong theory: try **Hallidayâ€“Resnickâ€“Krane**, **Griffiths**, and **Pathfinder** for Olympiad depth.\n* Practice past INPhO papers with solutions from HBCSE website.\n* Join peer groups, focus on written, stepwise problem-solving.\n\n### OCSC Preparation\n\n* Intensive training in both theoretical and experimental challenges.\n* Learn advanced topics: Relativity, Thermodynamics, Quantum.\n* Revise with mock tests and previous OCSC papers.\n\n---\n\n## Rewards & Recognition\n\n* **Qualification-based medals and certificates** across NSEP and INPhO levels.\n* OCSC attendees receive training, honor, and IIT/CMI admissions.\n* IPhO qualifiers gain national acclaim and potential career opportunities.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Facts Table\n\n| Feature           | Details                                         |\n| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| **Stage I**       | NSEP (Nov): 72 MCQs, +3/â€“1 singles; +6/0 multis |\n| **Stage II**      | INPhO (Jan/Feb): 5â€“6 subjective Qs (3â€¯hrs)      |\n| **OCSC**          | Top \\~35 shortlisted                            |\n| **IPhO Team**     | \\~5â€“6 members selected for IPhO                 |\n| **Syllabus**      | CBSE XIâ€“XII standard + advanced Olympiad-level  |\n| **Prep Strategy** | Classic textbooks + past papers + peer training |\n| **Calculator**    | Basic scientific (non-programmable) permitted   |\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Indian National Physics Olympiad (INPhO) Exam","description":"Prepare for Indian National Physics Olympiad (INPhO) with our mock tests."}},"__N_SSG":true}
